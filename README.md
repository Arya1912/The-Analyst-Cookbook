# The Analyst Cookbook

This repository serves as a centralized library of modular frameworks and standard operating procedures for data analysis. The goal is to move beyond one-off scripts toward reproducible, high-integrity workflows.

Each module represents a specific stage of the data lifecycle, emphasizing technical reliability and data quality—a mindset carried over from my background and previous experiences.

## Repository Structure

### Data Ingestion
Focuses on robust methods for extracting data from diverse sources including flat files, SQL databases, and APIs. These patterns prioritize schema validation and secure connection handling.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Standardized approaches to statistical profiling, distribution analysis, and identifying multivariate relationships to ensure deep data understanding before modeling.

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
Systematic procedures for handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering while maintaining data lineage and integrity.

*will add more in the later phases*

## Methodology
Every framework within this cookbook follows three core principles:
1. **Reproducibility:** Code is documented and structured so it can be executed reliably across different environments.
2. **Validation:** Entry and exit criteria are defined for every data stage to catch errors early.
3. **Efficiency:** Modular functions allow for the reuse of logic across multiple projects, reducing technical debt.

## Usage
The scripts provided are intended to be used as templates or imported as modules into larger data analysis projects.
